How to use FFmpeg

Last updated: 2019/9/5

## Converting a video taken by a DSLR camera

We use ffmpeg to convert a large video file taken by a DSLR camera or
smart phone by reencoding it using H.264 and AAC codecs. A video file
taken by a Canon 5D Mark 4 with FHD, 60fps, and All-I settings takes about
1Gb for a 47 seconds clip. The file size varies depending on the camera
video settings such as ISO, although it does not fluctuate much.

The following command reduces the file size by reencoding a video file with
almost no visual degradation. The same 1Gb file reduces to a 21Mb video
file, which makes it much easier for sharing it over messengers or
social networks. Furthermore, the proprietary mov file, which cannot be played
in many Android devices, can now be played with any Android video player.
Also, it preserves all metadata, including creation\_time, which are necessary
for organzing media files.

```
ffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 192k -ar 44100 -map_metadata 0 -preset slow output.mp4
```

Some important options are as follows:

* -c:v [ libx264 \| libx265 \| copy ]
* -crf [ 0 - 51 ]<br>
    0=lossless, 51=worst<br>
    for libx264, default: 23. 18=almost lossless<br>
    for libx265, default: 28.
* -c:a [ libfdk\_aac \| aac \| copy ]
* -map\_metadata 0
    copy global metadata from the first input file
* output.mp4<br>
    use mp4 container, as many apps, especially on Android, do not play
    videos in mov containers.

A complete description of options are in ffmpeg's
[H.264 page](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264).
