How to setup zsh

## Terminal: zsh

Many Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, and Mac OS X come with bash as
their default shell. There is no problem with bash, but with correctly set up
zsh, we can make the terminal much more productive. Main features that
I benefit the most from zsh combined with its plugins are:

* Press-tab navigation when navigating directories
* Displaying git repository status on the prompt
* Displaying a list of executed commands when running a reverse command search

### Install zsh, oh-my-zsh, and zsh's plugins

We first install zsh and its plugins as follows.

```sh
# Install zsh and oh-my-zsh
sudo apt install zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

# Install plugins
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-completions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions

vi ~/.zshrc
...
plugins=(
  gitfast
  colored-man-pages
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
  zsh-autosuggestions
)
...
```

### Install Pure Prompt
zsh's default prompt is quite slow when we go into a large git repo.
To fix this, we use faster Pure Prompt.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/zsh
git clone https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure.git ~/.config/zsh/pure

vi ~/.zshrc
autoload -U promptinit; promptinit
prompt pure
```

### Install fzf
fzf provides a much more intuitive reverse search (i.e., ``ctrl-r``) interface.
It displays a list of executed commands on the shell on an "overlayed-like" window,
and allows you to select a command using up/down keys.

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.config/fzf
~/.config/fzf/install

vi .zshrc
# Remove duplicate commands in the history
setopt hist_ignore_all_dups
```

### Set up Git with oh-my-zsh
With oh-my-zsh, git is not working as expected.
Run the following to bring back the normal git behaviors.

```sh
git config --global core.pager "less -erX"
git config --global core.editor /usr/bin/vim
git config --global diff.tool vimdiff
```
<!-- $GIT_PAGER or $PAGER -->

Finally, run the following to apply the settings.
```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```
